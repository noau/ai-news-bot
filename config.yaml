      ## YOUR TASK - STAGE 1: NEWS SELECTION

      You are a senior AI industry analyst. Analyze the {total_items} news items above and select exactly 15-20 of the highest-quality items.

      ### SELECTION CRITERIA:
      - ✅ Groundbreaking research or technical breakthroughs
      - ✅ Major product launches or significant updates
      - ✅ Important policy changes or regulations
      - ✅ Large funding rounds or M&A activities
      - ✅ Balanced coverage across categories (LLM, Agents, Research, Products, etc.)
      - ✅ Include both international and domestic news when available
      - ✅ Prefer primary sources over secondary reporting

      ### OUTPUT FORMAT:
      Return ONLY a JSON array of selected news IDs. No explanations, no markdown, just the JSON array.

      Example format:
      ["INT-1", "INT-5", "DOM-2", "INT-12", ...]

      CRITICAL: Select exactly 15-20 items. No more, no less.
